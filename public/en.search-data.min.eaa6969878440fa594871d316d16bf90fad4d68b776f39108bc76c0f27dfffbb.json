What does the symbol $\\Longrightarrow$ mean and when is $S \\Longrightarrow T$ true? 2.2 The Concept of a Proof\r#\rWhen do we use $\\dot{\\Longrightarrow}$ instead of $\\Longrightarrow$? Describe (informally) what a proof is. What is the difference between a proof sketch and a formal proof? 2.3 Propositional Logic\r#\rExplain the symbols $\\lnot, \\land, \\lor, \\rightarrow, \\leftrightarrow$. What is a truth table? Can you sketch the truth tables for the symbols above? How did we define a formula? What symbols are allowed to appear in a formula? Can you think of an arrow we saw that is not allowed to appear in a formula? What does it mean for two formulas to be equivalent? What is the symbol for it? Lemma 2.1 is important. Can you name and write down all the eight rules? Where did you shee similar rules before? What does the symbol $\\models$ mean? Is $A \\models B$ a statement or a formula? Can you define $\\equiv$ using $\\models$? What makes a formula (un)satisfiable and what is a tautology? What is the connection between $F$, $\\lnot F$ and these terms?

Recall the definitions of $\\forall x P(x)$ and $\\exists x P(x)$. What else needs to be specified apart from $P$? Using both $\\forall$ and $\\exists$ at least once and two different predicates $P$ and $Q$, construct a formula which is true for $U = \\mathbb{N}$. Read through 2.4.8 again and do the exercise if you have not already. Then take a sheet of paper and try to write down all the rules you remember from that section.

If you need feedback for another exercise please tell me directly, per default I will only correct the bonus. Read the task description carefully and make sure you satisfy everything it asks from you. If the tasks says \u0026ldquo;argue by comparing truth tables\u0026rdquo; you need to compute a truth table and argue with a sentence. Every proof should end with a sentence like \u0026ldquo;This is what I showed and therefore I conclude the statement is true\u0026rdquo;. Make it clear what exactly you proved and why you think you proved it. Use correct notation. Don\u0026rsquo;t make up your own abbreviations. (If you do so, you need to explain them.) In general, your submissions this week looked very good and I could see that most of you understood the topic well [: Predicate Logic\r#\rLast week we worked a lot with propositional logic and symbols like $\\lnot , \\lor , \\land , \\rightarrow , A , B$. But those types of formulas are very limited in their expression. Predicate Logic adds new symbols which allow us to express more concepts in our formulas:\nPredicates are functions $U^k \\rightarrow {0,1}$. They take k values from the universe $U$ and then give a truth value depending on them. Whenever we want to work with predicates we need to specify the universe we are working in.\nAn easy way to define a predicate is specifying when exactly it yields true. For example $$ P(x)=1 \\Longleftrightarrow x , \\text{is prime} $$ defines a precidate P gives true exactly when its input is prime.\nThe universe is very important! Interpreting the formula $\\forall x \\exists y (y \u0026lt; x)$ with $U=\\mathbb{N}$ or $U=\\mathbb{Z}$ makes a big difference.\nQuantifiers allow us to reason about the elements in the universe:\n$\\forall x P(x)$ means \u0026ldquo;$P(x)$ is true for all $x$ in $U$\u0026rdquo; $\\exists x P(x)$ means \u0026ldquo;there exists some (at least one) $x$ in $U$ for which $P(x)$ is true. $\\exists x$ does not mean \u0026ldquo;exactly one\u0026rdquo;\nNegating Quantors\r#\rMake sure to read the chapters in the script about predicate logic. If you need some more practice, look at the page on discmath.ch\nExercise Sheet recommendations\r#\rAll exercises this week are important! 2.4 is a very fun riddle, but don\u0026rsquo;t worry if you cannot solve it. For 2.3, make sure that you only apply one rule per step and apply them exactly as in Lemma 2.1. Specifically:\nDouble negation ($\\lnot \\lnot A \\equiv A$) is a rule. Associativity is a rule. You cannot just reorder brackets. The rules in Lemma 2.1 all have a direction. If the rule says $A \\lor (A \\land B) \\equiv A$ then it says exactly that, and not $(A \\land B) \\lor A \\equiv A$. Also read carefully exactly what requirements your final formula needs to fulfill. The task is very doable, so be sure to be exact so you get your well-deserved bonus points.\n"}]
