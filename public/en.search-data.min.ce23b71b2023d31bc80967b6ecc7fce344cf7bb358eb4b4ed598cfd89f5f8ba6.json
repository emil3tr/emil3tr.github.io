It is held in german.\nHere you can find a page for each session under the sessions tab.\nI also create reading questions for each chapter of the script. Those are short quizzes you can do after reading the corresponding chapter to see if you understood what you just read or to recap it. Note that they are not in any way similar to exam questions and I won\u0026rsquo;t include solutions for most of them, so if anything is unclear please ask in class!\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/diskmath_hs25/reading_questions/chapter2/","title":"Script Chapter 2","section":"Reading Questions","content":"\r2.1 Mathematical Statements\r#\rWhat is a statement?
