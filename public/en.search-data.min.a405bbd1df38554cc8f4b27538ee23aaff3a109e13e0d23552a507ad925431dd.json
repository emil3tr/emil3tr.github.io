Read the task description carefully and make sure you satisfy everything it asks from you. If the tasks says \u0026ldquo;argue by comparing truth tables\u0026rdquo; you need to compute a truth table and argue with a sentence. Every proof should end with a sentence like \u0026ldquo;This is what I showed and therefore I conclude the statement is true\u0026rdquo;. Make it clear what exactly you proved and why you think you proved it. Use correct notation. Don\u0026rsquo;t make up your own abbreviations. (If you do so, you need to explain them.) When you do truth tables, start with 000 at the top and end with 111 at the bottom (convention). In general, your submissions this week looked very good and I could see that most of you understood the topic well [: Predicate Logic\r#\rLast week we worked a lot with propositional logic and symbols like $\\lnot , \\lor , \\land , \\rightarrow , A , B$. But those types of formulas are very limited in their expression. Predicate Logic adds new symbols which allow us to express more concepts in our formulas:\nPredicates are functions $U^k \\rightarrow {0,1}$. They take k values from the universe $U$ and then give a truth value depending on them. Whenever we want to work with predicates we need to specify the universe we are working in.\nAn easy way to define a predicate is specifying when exactly it yields true. For example $$ P(x)=1 \\Longleftrightarrow x \\thinspace \\text{is prime} $$ defines a precidate P that gives true exactly when its input is prime.\nThe universe is very important! Interpreting the formula $\\forall x \\exists y (y \u0026lt; x)$ with $U=\\mathbb{N}$ or $U=\\mathbb{Z}$ makes a big difference.\nQuantifiers allow us to reason about the elements in the universe:\n$\\forall x P(x)$ means \u0026ldquo;$P(x)$ is true for all $x$ in $U$\u0026rdquo; $\\exists x P(x)$ means \u0026ldquo;there exists some (at least one) $x$ in $U$ for which $P(x)$ is true. $\\exists x$ does not mean \u0026ldquo;exactly one\u0026rdquo;\nNegating Quantors\r#\rWhen we negate a quantor, we pull the $\\lnot$ inside and change the quantor. So $$ \\lnot \\forall x P(x) \\equiv \\exists x \\lnot P(x) $$ and $$ \\lnot \\exists x P(x) \\equiv \\forall x \\lnot P(x) $$\nMake sure to read the chapters in the script about predicate logic. If you need some more practice, look at the page on discmath.ch\nExercise Sheet Recommendations\r#\rAll exercises this week are important! 2.4 is a very fun riddle, but don\u0026rsquo;t worry if you cannot solve it. For 2.3, make sure that you only apply one rule per step and apply them exactly as in Lemma 2.1. Specifically:\nDouble negation ($\\lnot \\lnot A \\equiv A$) is a rule. Associativity is a rule. You cannot just reorder brackets. The rules in Lemma 2.1 all have a direction. If the rule says $A \\lor (A \\land B) \\equiv A$ then it says exactly that, and not $(A \\land B) \\lor A \\equiv A$. Also read carefully exactly what requirements your final formula needs to fulfill. The task is very doable, so be sure to be exact so you get your well-deserved bonus points.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/docs/diskmath_hs25/sessions/week3/","title":"Week3 - Proof Patterns","section":"Sessions","content":"\rWeek 3 - Proof Patterns\r#\rThis week we focus a lot on proof patterns since it is a very important topic. We also quickly review predicate logic.\nResources\r#\rSlides: pdf Proof Examples: pdf Kahoot: link made by Tobias Steinbrecher \u0026lt;3 Statements vs Formulas: pdf (in German) Notes on Last Exercise Sheet\r#\rOverall the submissions were very good (: Be careful when you apply rules to larger formulas. You still need to keep the brackets. For example $\\lnot (A \\land B) \\lor C$ becomes $(\\lnot A \\lor \\lnot B) \\lor C$ when using de Morgans rule! By now you probably figured out that the grading scheme can be very strict, so don\u0026rsquo;t be too discouraged if you lost a lot of points. Proving Proof Patterns with Propositional Logic\r#\rOkay, we we already know a lot of proof patterns. But what if we want to create our own one and show that it is actually correct? Or what if someone gives us a proof pattern they came up with and we want to show them that it does not work?\nWe can do both of those things using propositional logic! I will explain the idea first and then give examples for both proving and disproving a proof pattern.\nWhen you are asked to evaluate a proof pattern, it will always be of the following form: It states what statement $S$ it wants to prove and then gives some other statements. Then it claims if we prove those other statements, we have actually proven the statement $S$. For example, a proposed proof pattern might look like this:\nWe want to prove the statement $S$, we first prove another statement $T$. Then we show that $T \\implies S$\nThis proof pattern consists of two parts (which should prove $S$):\nWe prove $T$ We prove $T \\implies S$ You might also see proof patterns with more steps and parts. Don\u0026rsquo;t get confused! The first step is always to find out what statements the pattern consists of.\nGreat, but how do we work with the proof pattern now? Here is where the logic part comes in. We can actually rewrite the pattern using propositional logic. To do this, we take each of the statements, convert them to propositional logic and then combine them with $\\land$. To avoid confusion, we use the letters $A, B, C, \\dots$ in our formulas and let their truth values correspond to the truth of the statements. For our example proof pattern this would look like this:\nWe choose the symbol $A$ and $B$, which correspond to the statements $S$ and $T$ and their truth values respectively. Now we rewrite the statements in propositional logic:\n\u0026ldquo;We prove $T$\u0026rdquo; becomes $B$ \u0026ldquo;We prove $T \\implies S$\u0026rdquo; becomes $B \\rightarrow A$ Combining those we get: $F = B \\land (B \\rightarrow A)$\nOkay, we tranformed our statements to a formula $F$. But how do we reason about the correctness of the proof pattern? There is actually a very simple rule:\nThe proof pattern is correct exactly if:\n$$ F \\vDash A $$\nWhere $F$ is the formula we get from the proof pattern and $A$ is the logical variable corresponding to the statement we want to prove. This means we can disprove a proof pattern by showing:\n$$ F \\nvDash A $$\nWhy does this work? We want to show that our statement $S$ is true if we proved all the other statements. Our formula $F$ evaluating to true represents the fact that all the statements are true (since we \u0026ldquo;linked\u0026rdquo; each propositional variable to a statement and combined them with $\\land$). If $F \\vDash A$ then this means that if all our statements are actually true ($F$ is true), then $S$ must also be true ($A$ is true). If the logic consequence does not hold, then there must exist some truth assignment where $F$ gives true but $A$ is set to false. This means that $S$ can be false even if all our statements are true, which means the pattern is not valid.\nIf the statement you want to show is not simply one statement $S$, but for example $S \\implies T$, then you need to transform that to propositional logic too and show the consequence. This should look like:\n$$ F \\vDash (A \\rightarrow B) $$\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s finish our small example. We show that $F \\vDash A$:\n$$ \\begin{align*} F \u0026amp; = B \\land (B \\rightarrow A) \\\\ \u0026amp; \\equiv B \\land (\\lnot B \\lor A) \\\\ \u0026amp; \\equiv (B \\land \\lnot B) \\lor (B \\land A) \\\\ \u0026amp; \\equiv \\bot \\lor (B \\land A) \\\\ \u0026amp; \\equiv B \\land A \\\\ \u0026amp; \\vDash A \\end{align*} $$\nStep by Step\r#\rLet\u0026rsquo;s go over the method step by step again before we do some examples:\nExtract the Statements\r#\rSee what statement $S$ should be proved by the pattern. Then find all the statements we use to prove that statement. (It does not need to be named $S$, we just assume that here for simplicity.)\nTransform the Statements to Prop. Logic\r#\rDefine propositional variables $A,B, \\dots$ for the statements. Transform each statement individually and then combine them with $\\land$ to get a formula $F$.\n(Dis)prove the Cogical Consequence\r#\rYou can prove $F \\vDash A$ either by equivalence transformations or truth tables. You can disprove it by finding a truth assignment where $F$ gives true but $A$ is set to false.\nExample 1: Proving Correctness\r#\rThis is an exercise from 2020. We get the following proof pattern and want to show that it is correct:\nTo prove $S$: Find statements $U$ and $T$. Prove $T$, assuming $S$ is false. Prove $U$, assuming $S$ is false. Show that not both $T$ and $U$ are true.\nStep 1: We have three statements here:\nnot S $\\implies$ T not S $\\implies$ U not both U and T are true Those statements should show S.\nStep 2: We use $A$ for $S$, $B$ for $T$ and $C$ for $U$. The formulas are:\n$\\lnot A \\rightarrow B$ $\\lnot A \\rightarrow C$ $\\lnot (B \\land C)$ Combining them we get:\n$$ (\\lnot A \\rightarrow B) \\land (\\lnot A \\rightarrow C) \\land \\lnot (B \\land C) $$\nStep 3: To show that the proof pattern is correct we now need to show:\n$$ (\\lnot A \\rightarrow B) \\land (\\lnot A \\rightarrow C) \\land \\lnot (B \\land C) \\vDash A $$\nYou can use a truth table to show that this holds. This shows that the proof pattern is indeed correct.\nExample 2: Disproving Correctness\r#\rWe want to show that the following proof pattern is incorrect:\nTo prove $S \\implies T$ we find a statement $R$ and prove that R is true. Then we show that if $R$ is true, $S$ must be true. Finally, we show that at least one of $R$ and $T$ must be true.\nStep 1: We want to show $S \\implies T$ using three statements:\n$R$ is true $ R\\implies S$ $R$ or $T$ (or both) must be true Step 2: We use $A$ for $S$, $B$ for $T$ and $C$ for $R$. The formulas are:\n$C$ $C \\rightarrow A$ $C \\lor B$ Combined we get:\n$$ C \\land (C \\rightarrow A) \\land (C \\lor B) $$\nStep 3: We want to show that:\n$$ C \\land (C \\rightarrow A) \\land (C \\lor B) \\nvDash A \\rightarrow B $$\nNote that we transformed the statement the pattern tries to prove into $A \\rightarrow B$.\nFor the truth assignment $A=1, B=0, C=1$ the left hand side evaluates to true, but the right hand side evaluates to false. This shows that the proof pattern is not valid.\nProof Patterns\r#\rRead the script and look at discmath.ch for more examples. The proof patterns are very standard so you can also find good explanations on the internet.\nExercise Sheet Recommendations\r#\rDo all the exercises! 3.6 2) is a three-star, but actually not that difficult (and very similar to the example in the script if you need a hint), so definitely try it!\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/docs/diskmath_hs25/sessions/week4/","title":"Week4 - Sets","section":"Sessions","content":"\rWeek4 - Sets\r#\rThis week we introduce sets and the basic set operations.

You should always use brackets to make the precedence in your formulas clear. Use the correct arrows (look at week 3 for a guide). Read the task carefully! If it says \u0026ldquo;do it this way\u0026rdquo; then you have to do it this way. Explain what you are doing! It is not enough if the solution makes sense in you head. A proof needs to be exact and cannot leave room for interpretation. Be careful about restrictions in the exercise. You need to be precise in Diskmath! If \u0026ldquo;\u0026lt;\u0026rdquo; is a predicate does not mean that \u0026ldquo;\u0026gt;\u0026rdquo; is also one. You proof should begin with \u0026ldquo;We prove \u0026hellip; by showing \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; and end with \u0026ldquo;This proves the statement by \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. If you cannot describe (or at least have a general idea about) 1) what you want to prove 2) what you need to do to prove it 3) how you are going to do that, then you should not start writing the proof yet. About Sets\r#\rSets are some of the most important objects in mathematics. A lot of things (like the natural numbers) are derived from set theory. If you want to read more on how we define sets, you can look at discmath.ch or search for \u0026ldquo;ZFK Axioms\u0026rdquo; online.\nSo what is a set? For us, the hintrmal definition \u0026ldquo;a collection of well defined objects\u0026rdquo; should be enough. We write $a \\in A$ if $a$ is an element of $A$.\nA set can only contain each element once. This means an object is either inside the set or not.\nThe script contains a very good explanation for the set operations like $\\subseteq$, $\\cup$, \u0026hellip; Make sure that you not only understand them intuitively, but also the formal definitions.\nThe Powerset\r#\rOne of the more difficult set operations is the powerset of a set.\nWe define the powerset of a set $A$ as: $$ S \\in P(A) \\Longleftrightarrow S \\subseteq A $$ In words: \u0026ldquo;the powerset of A contains all subsets of A\u0026rdquo;.\nNote that the powerset is a set which contains sets. It has the following interesting properties:\n$A \\in P(A)$ $\\varnothing \\in P(A)$ for any set $A$ $A$ is not necessarily a subset of $P(A)$! $P(A)$ contains sets, which contain elements of $A$. But it does not (necessarily) contain the elements of $A$. $|A| = k \\implies |P(A)| = 2^{k}$ Proving Set properties\r#\rShowing A is Subset of B\r#\rTo show that $A$ is a subset of $B$, we need to show that every element in $A$ is also in $B$. The easiest way of doing this is by taking an arbitrary but fixed element from $A$ and then showing that it is also in $B$. This would look something like:\nLet $x$ in A be arbitrary. $$ \\begin{align*} \u0026amp; x \\in A \\\\ \\implies \u0026amp; \\dots \\\\ \\implies \u0026amp; \\dots \\\\ \\implies \u0026amp; x \\in B \\end{align*} $$\nWhen we say \u0026ldquo;let x be arbitrary but fixed\u0026rdquo;, then we mean that we take any element of the set. This means that all of your steps afterwards have to work for any element of the set!\nShowing A = B\r#\rThere are two ways of showing $A = B$. The first one uses a very useful statement from the script:\n$$ A = B \\Longleftrightarrow A \\subseteq B \\land B \\subseteq A $$\nThis means if we need to show that $A = B$ we can simply show both $A \\subseteq B$ and $B \\subseteq A$ as above.\nThe second way is by showing directly that any element in $A$ is also in $B$ and vice versa. A lot of times this also works but might be a little bit more difficult. We let $x$ be arbitrary and show:\n$$ \\begin{align*} \u0026amp; x \\in A \\\\ \\Longleftrightarrow \u0026amp; \\dots \\\\ \\Longleftrightarrow \u0026amp; \\dots \\\\ \\Longleftrightarrow \u0026amp; x \\in B \\end{align*} $$\nNote that for this type of proof all your implications need to be double-sided! So you need to make sure that all rows imply the row above and below it!\nYou can find an example for this in the exercises.\nUsing Logic\r#\rIn a lot of cases we can use propositional logic to prove statements regarding sets. Those proofs will mostly follow the same pattern:\nUse the definitions to transform a statement or set from set-language into logic-language. Use propositional logic results to refactor the statement or set Use the defintions again to get back to set-language A simple example:\nSay we want to work with the set $B \\cup (C \\setminus A)$. Now:\n$$ \\begin{align*} \u0026amp; x \\in B \\cup (C \\setminus A) \\\\ \\implies \u0026amp; x \\in B \\lor x \\in (C \\setminus A) \\\\ \\implies \u0026amp; x \\in B \\lor (x \\in C \\land \\lnot(x \\in A)) \\end{align*} $$\nNow we can use Lemma 2.1 to refactor the statement and then transform it into a set again with the definitions.\nRelations\r#\rLook at discmath.ch.\nExercise Sheet Recommendations\r#\rDo all the exercises!

You can find more examples there.

Write \u0026ldquo;Take any a,b \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;This holds for any a,b in \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; or something similar. Jusify your steps!! Don\u0026rsquo;t make it more complicated than it needs to be. Make sure you exactly understand what you need to show before you start. Proving Countability of a Set\r#\rWe know that a set $A$ is countable if $A \\preccurlyeq \\mathbb{N}$, which we can show by finding an injection from $A$ to $\\mathbb{N}$. But we can also find an injection from $A$ to any countable set:\nIf there is an injection $\\varphi : A \\rightarrow B$ and $B$ is countable, then $A$ is also countable.\nProof: Since $B$ is countable we know $B \\preccurlyeq \\mathbb{N}$ and since we found an injection from $A$ to $B$ we also know $A \\preccurlyeq B$. Now the transitivity of $\\preccurlyeq$ implies $A \\preccurlyeq \\mathbb{N}$.\nThis means we can use some of the countable sets we already know as $B$. Some useful ones are: $\\mathbb{N}$, $\\{ 0,1 \\}^{*}$ (the set of finite bitstrings), $\\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N}$ or any other countable set that you can create using the rules in the script. So proving countability usually goes like this:\nFind the Injection\r#\rThis is the hardest part. Get an intuition about the set and find the injection $\\varphi$.\nProve that it is a Function\r#\rTo prove that $\\varphi$ is a function we need to show that it is well-defined and totally defined. Even if those proprties might seem obvious to you, you still need to prove them!\nProve the Injectivity\r#\rFinally, prove that $\\varphi$ is actually an injection.\nConclusion\r#\rConclude with the argument above that the set is countable.\nProving Uncountability\r#\rIf we want to prove uncountability we first need a lemma:\nIf $B$ is uncountable and there is an injection $\\varphi : B \\rightarrow A$ from $B$ to $A$ then $A$ is also uncountable.\nProof: Since there is an injection from $B$ to $A$ we know that $B \\preccurlyeq A$. Now assume $A$ was countable. Then $A \\preccurlyeq \\mathbb{N}$ and per injectivity of $\\preccurlyeq$ we get $B \\preccurlyeq \\mathbb{N}$. But this means that $B$ is countable, which is a contradiction.\nWhat you just saw is the magic sentence. Whenever you prove uncountability you will copy-paste this sentence at the start / end of the proof. (Either from your brain or cheatsheet.)\nSo now we have a method to prove uncountability. Most of the time you will use $\\{ 0,1 \\}^{\\infty}$ as your set $B$.\nFind the Injection\r#\rThis is the hardest part. Get an intuition about the set and find the injection $\\varphi$.\nProve that it is a Function\r#\rTo prove that $\\varphi$ is a function we need to show that it is well-defined and totally defined. Even if those proprties might seem obvious to you, you still need to prove them!\nProve the Injectivity\r#\rFinally, prove that $\\varphi$ is actually an injection.\nConclusion\r#\rConclude with the magic sentence above that the set is countable.\nSee that the steps are basically the same as above? Yes! Proving uncountability and countability is not actually that difficult. After you understoof the set you are working with and found the injection, the rest is mostly just mechanical work.\nLook at discmath.ch for a more in-depth guide and some useful tips!\nExercise Sheet Recommendations\r#\rAll the exercises this week are good (and important).

I will instead hold it on Tuesday, Novemember 11 at 16:15 in LFW B3. If you cannot attend: If you are not inscribed in my group, visit the tutorial you are inscribed in. Everyone in my group: If your last name starts with A-M then go to CHN D42, if it starts with N-Z go to LFW C11 (both at the usual time 16:15 on Monday).\nResources\r#\rKahoot: link Exercises + Solutions: pdf Intuition Drawings: pdf (Extended) Euclid Algorithm: pdf CRT Brute Force Method: pdf Slides: pdf Exercise Sheet Questions: link You can find even more exercises in the books linked here.\nNotes on Last Exercise Sheet\r#\rI was surprised by how well they got solved on average! JUSTIFY EVERY STEP. (I am sloppy in my solutions that I give you, but you need to justify everything!) If you haven\u0026rsquo;t already, take a look at 6.6 (a lot of old exam questions are similar) Exercise Sheet Recommendations\r#\rPretty much all of them look useful to me. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have time, then leave out the three-stars.\n"},{"id":10,"href":"/docs/diskmath_hs25/sessions/week8/","title":"Week8 - Algebra","section":"Sessions","content":"\rWeek8 - Algebra\r#\rThis week we start with Algebra. We discuss monoids and groups. Then we talk about homomorphisms and do some proof exercises.\nResources\r#\rKahoot: link\nExercises + Solutions: coming soon\ndiscmath.ch has some good chapters on Algebra.\nAbstract Algebra by Thomas W. Judson is a great further reading.\nCategroy Theory Script can give you another perspective on some topics. They use different notation than this course, so proceed with caution!\nNotes on Last Exercise Sheet\r#\rYou did well overall (: JUSTIFY EVERY STEP. Exercise Sheet Recommendations\r#\rDo all of the exercises. It is not necessary to do the exam exercises already if you don\u0026rsquo;t really have time for them. Make sure you are exact and formal on the other ones!\n"}]
