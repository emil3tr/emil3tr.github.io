It is held in german.\nHere you can find a page for each session under the sessions tab.\nI also create reading questions for each chapter of the script. Those are short quizzes you can do after reading the corresponding chapter to see if you understood what you just read or to recap it. Note that they are not in any way similar to exam questions and I won\u0026rsquo;t include solutions for most of them, so if anything is unclear please ask in class!\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/diskmath_hs25/reading_questions/chapter2/","title":"Script Chapter 2","section":"Reading Questions","content":"\r2.1 Mathematical Statements\r#\rWhat is a statement? What does the symbol $\\Longrightarrow$ mean and when is $S \\Longrightarrow T$ true? 2.2 The Concept of a Proof\r#\rWhen do we use $\\dot{\\Longrightarrow}$ instead of $\\Longrightarrow$? Describe (informally) what a proof is. What is the difference between a proof sketch and a formal proof? 2.3 Propositional Logic\r#\rExplain the symbols $\\lnot, \\land, \\lor, \\rightarrow, \\leftrightarrow$. What is a truth table? Can you sketch the truth tables for the symbols above? How did we define a formula? What symbols are allowed to appear in a formula? Can you think of an arrow we saw that is not allowed to appear in a formula? What does it mean for two formulas to be equivalent? What is the symbol for it? Lemma 2.1 is important. Can you name and write down all the eight rules? Where did you shee similar rules before? What does the symbol $\\models$ mean? Is $A \\models B$ a statement or a formula? Can you define $\\equiv$ using $\\models$? What makes a formula (un)satisfiable and what is a tautology? What is the connection between $F$, $\\lnot F$ and these terms? Fill in the blanks with formula or statement: \u0026ldquo;____ $\\rightarrow$ ____\u0026rdquo; is a ____ \u0026ldquo;____ $\\Rightarrow$ ____\u0026rdquo; is a ____ \u0026ldquo;____ $\\models$ ____\u0026rdquo; is a ____ 2.4 Predicate Logic\r#\rGive an example of a predicate. Recall the definitions of $\\forall x , P(x)$ and $\\exists x , P(x)$. What else needs to be specified apart from $P$? Using both $\\forall$ and $\\exists$ at least once and two different predicates $P$ and $Q$, construct a formula which is true for $U = \\mathbb{N}$. Read through 2.4.8 again and do the exercise if you have not already. Then take a sheet of paper and try to write down all the rules you remember from that section.
