If you need feedback for another exercise please tell me directly, per default I will only correct the bonus. Read the task description carefully and make sure you satisfy everything it asks from you. If the tasks says \u0026ldquo;argue by comparing truth tables\u0026rdquo; you need to compute a truth table and argue with a sentence. Every proof should end with a sentence like \u0026ldquo;This is what I showed and therefore I conclude the statement is true\u0026rdquo;. Make it clear what exactly you proved and why you think you proved it. Use correct notation. Don\u0026rsquo;t make up your own abbreviations. (If you do so, you need to explain them.) When you do truth tables, start with 000 at the top and end with 111 at the bottom (convention). In general, your submissions this week looked very good and I could see that most of you understood the topic well [: Predicate Logic\r#\rLast week we worked a lot with propositional logic and symbols like $\\lnot , \\lor , \\land , \\rightarrow , A , B$. But those types of formulas are very limited in their expression. Predicate Logic adds new symbols which allow us to express more concepts in our formulas:\nPredicates are functions $U^k \\rightarrow {0,1}$. They take k values from the universe $U$ and then give a truth value depending on them. Whenever we want to work with predicates we need to specify the universe we are working in.\nAn easy way to define a predicate is specifying when exactly it yields true. For example $$ P(x)=1 \\Longleftrightarrow x \\thinspace \\text{is prime} $$ defines a precidate P that gives true exactly when its input is prime.\nThe universe is very important! Interpreting the formula $\\forall x \\exists y (y \u0026lt; x)$ with $U=\\mathbb{N}$ or $U=\\mathbb{Z}$ makes a big difference.\nQuantifiers allow us to reason about the elements in the universe:\n$\\forall x P(x)$ means \u0026ldquo;$P(x)$ is true for all $x$ in $U$\u0026rdquo; $\\exists x P(x)$ means \u0026ldquo;there exists some (at least one) $x$ in $U$ for which $P(x)$ is true. $\\exists x$ does not mean \u0026ldquo;exactly one\u0026rdquo;\nNegating Quantors\r#\rWhen we negate a quantor, we pull the $\\lnot$ inside and change the quantor. So $$ \\lnot \\forall x P(x) \\equiv \\exists x \\lnot P(x) $$ and $$ \\lnot \\exists x P(x) \\equiv \\forall x \\lnot P(x) $$\nMake sure to read the chapters in the script about predicate logic. If you need some more practice, look at the page on discmath.ch\nExercise Sheet Recommendations\r#\rAll exercises this week are important! 2.4 is a very fun riddle, but don\u0026rsquo;t worry if you cannot solve it. For 2.3, make sure that you only apply one rule per step and apply them exactly as in Lemma 2.1. Specifically:\nDouble negation ($\\lnot \\lnot A \\equiv A$) is a rule. Associativity is a rule. You cannot just reorder brackets. The rules in Lemma 2.1 all have a direction. If the rule says $A \\lor (A \\land B) \\equiv A$ then it says exactly that, and not $(A \\land B) \\lor A \\equiv A$. Also read carefully exactly what requirements your final formula needs to fulfill. The task is very doable, so be sure to be exact so you get your well-deserved bonus points.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/docs/diskmath_hs25/sessions/week3/","title":"Week3 - Proof Patterns","section":"Sessions","content":"\rWeek 3 - Proof Patterns\r#\rThis week we focus a lot on proof patterns since it is a very important topic. We also quickly review predicate logic.\nResources\r#\rSlides: pdf Proof Examples: pdf Kahoot: link made by Tobias Steinbrecher \u0026lt;3 Statements vs Formulas: pdf (in German) Notes on Last Exercise Sheet\r#\rOverall the submissions were very good (: Be careful when you apply rules to larger formulas. You still need to keep the brackets. For example $\\lnot (A \\land B) \\lor C$ becomes $(\\lnot A \\lor \\lnot B) \\lor C$ when using de Morgans rule! By now you probably figured out that the grading scheme can be very strict, so don\u0026rsquo;t be too discouraged if you lost a lot of points. Proving Proof Patterns with Propositional Logic\r#\rOkay, we we already know a lot of proof patterns. But what if we want to create our own one and show that it is actually correct? Or what if someone gives us a proof pattern they came up with and we want to show them that it does not work?\nWe can do both of those things using propositional logic! I will explain the idea first and then give examples for both proving and disproving a proof pattern.\nWhen you are asked to evaluate a proof pattern, it will always be of the following form: It states what statement $S$ it wants to prove and then gives some other statements. Then it claims if we prove those other statements, we have actually proven the statement $S$. For example, a proposed proof pattern might look like this:\nWe want to prove the statement $S$, we first prove another statement $T$. Then we show that $T \\implies S$\nThis proof pattern consists of two parts (which should prove $S$):\nWe prove $T$ We prove $T \\implies S$ You might also see proof patterns with more steps and parts. Don\u0026rsquo;t get confused! The first step is always to find out what statements the pattern consists of.\nGreat, but how do we work with the proof pattern now? Here is where the logic part comes in. We can actually rewrite the pattern using propositional logic. To do this, we take each of the statements, convert them to propositional logic and then combine them with $\\land$. To avoid confusion, we use the letters $A, B, C, \\dots$ in our formulas and let their truth values correspond to the truth of the statements. For our example proof pattern this would look like this:\nWe choose the symbol $A$ and $B$, which correspond to the statements $S$ and $T$ and their truth values respectively. Now we rewrite the statements in propositional logic:\n\u0026ldquo;We prove $T$\u0026rdquo; becomes $B$ \u0026ldquo;We prove $T \\implies S$\u0026rdquo; becomes $B \\rightarrow A$ Combining those we get: $F = B \\land (B \\rightarrow A)$\nOkay, we tranformed our statements to a formula $F$. But how do we reason about the correctness of the proof pattern? There is actually a very simple rule:\nThe proof pattern is correct exactly if:\n$$ F \\vDash A $$\nWhere $F$ is the formula we get from the proof pattern and $A$ is the logical variable corresponding to the statement we want to prove. This means we can disprove a proof pattern by showing:\n$$ F \\nvDash A $$\nWhy does this work? We want to show that our statement $S$ is true if we proved all the other statements. Our formula $F$ evaluating to true represents the fact that all the statements are true (since we \u0026ldquo;linked\u0026rdquo; each propositional variable to a statement and combined them with $\\land$). If $F \\vDash A$ then this means that if all our statements are actually true ($F$ is true), then $S$ must also be true ($A$ is true). If the logic consequence does not hold, then there must exist some truth assignment where $F$ gives true but $A$ is set to false. This means that $S$ can be false even if all our statements are true, which means the pattern is not valid.\nIf the statement you want to show is not simply one statement $S$, but for example $S \\implies T$, then you need to transform that to propositional logic too and show the consequence. This should look like:\n$$ F \\vDash (A \\rightarrow B) $$\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s finish our small example. We show that $F \\vDash A$:\n$$ \\begin{align*} F \u0026amp; = B \\land (B \\rightarrow A) \\\\ \u0026amp; \\equiv B \\land (\\lnot B \\lor A) \\\\ \u0026amp; \\equiv (B \\land \\lnot B) \\lor (B \\land A) \\\\ \u0026amp; \\equiv \\bot \\lor (B \\land A) \\\\ \u0026amp; \\equiv B \\land A \\\\ \u0026amp; \\vDash A \\end{align*} $$\nStep by Step\r#\rLet\u0026rsquo;s go over the method step by step again before we do some examples:\nExtract the Statements\r#\rSee what statement $S$ should be proved by the pattern. Then find all the statements we use to prove that statement. (It does not need to be named $S$, we just assume that here for simplicity.)\nTransform the Statements to Prop. Logic\r#\rDefine propositional variables $A,B, \\dots$ for the statements. Transform each statement individually and then combine them with $\\land$ to get a formula $F$.\n(Dis)prove the Cogical Consequence\r#\rYou can prove $F \\vDash A$ either by equivalence transformations or truth tables. You can disprove it by finding a truth assignment where $F$ gives true but $A$ is set to false.\nExample 1: Proving Correctness\r#\rThis is an exercise from 2020. We get the following proof pattern and want to show that it is correct:\nTo prove $S$: Find statements $U$ and $T$. Prove $T$, assuming $S$ is false. Prove $U$, assuming $S$ is false. Show that not both $T$ and $U$ are true.\nStep 1: We have three statements here:\nnot S $\\implies$ T not S $\\implies$ U not both U and T are true Those statements should show S.\nStep 2: We use $A$ for $S$, $B$ for $T$ and $C$ for $U$. The formulas are:\n$\\lnot A \\rightarrow B$ $\\lnot A \\rightarrow C$ $\\lnot (B \\land C)$ Combining them we get:\n$$ (\\lnot A \\rightarrow B) \\land (\\lnot A \\rightarrow C) \\land \\lnot (B \\land C) $$\nStep 3: To show that the proof pattern is correct we now need to show:\n$$ (\\lnot A \\rightarrow B) \\land (\\lnot A \\rightarrow C) \\land \\lnot (B \\land C) \\vDash A $$\nYou can use a truth table to show that this holds. This shows that the proof pattern is indeed correct.\nExample 2: Disproving Correctness\r#\rWe want to show that the following proof pattern is incorrect:\nTo prove $S \\implies T$ we find a statement $R$ and prove that R is true. Then we show that if $R$ is true, $S$ must be true. Finally, we show that at least one of $R$ and $T$ must be true.\nStep 1: We want to show $S \\implies T$ using three statements:\n$R$ is true $ R\\implies S$ $R$ or $T$ (or both) must be true Step 2: We use $A$ for $S$, $B$ for $T$ and $C$ for $R$. The formulas are:\n$C$ $C \\rightarrow A$ $C \\lor B$ Combined we get:\n$$ C \\land (C \\rightarrow A) \\land (C \\lor B) $$\nStep 3: We want to show that:\n$$ C \\land (C \\rightarrow A) \\land (C \\lor B) \\nvDash A \\rightarrow B $$\nNote that we transformed the statement the pattern tries to prove into $A \\rightarrow B$.\nFor the truth assignment $A=1, B=0, C=1$ the left hand side evaluates to true, but the right hand side evaluates to false. This shows that the proof pattern is not valid.\nProof Patterns\r#\rRead the script and look at discmath.ch for more examples. The proof patterns are very standard so you can also find good explanations on the internet.\nExercise Sheet Recommendations\r#\rDo all the exercises! 3.6 2) is a three-star, but actually not that difficult (and very similar to the example in the script if you need a hint), so definitely try it!\n"}]
