# Diskmath HS25 Teaching

The exercise class I teach takes place in CHN D48 on Mondays 16:15 - 18:00. It is held in german.

Here you can find a page for each session under the [sessions]({{% relref "sessions" %}}) tab.

I also create [reading questions]({{% relref "reading_questions" %}}) for each chapter of the script. Those are short quizzes you can do after reading the corresponding chapter to see if you understood what you just read or to recap it. Note that they are not in any way similar to exam questions and I won't include solutions for most of them, so if anything is unclear please ask in class!
