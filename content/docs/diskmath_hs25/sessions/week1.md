## Exercise Sheet Recommendations

All exercises this week are important and you should have a look at them. Don't forget to hand in **1.5** to receive bonus points! For **1.6** remember to only apply **one** rule each step and **exactly** that rule. Even if some steps might be obvious to you, being exact is very important in Diskmath and you should start developing good habits early on.
