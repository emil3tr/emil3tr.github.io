# Week7 - Number Theory

This week we cover the entire number theory chapter. We talk about gcd, lcm, primes, divisors, modulo calculations and more. Then we practice some (old exam) excercises. Lastly we learn the Euclid Algorithm for finding the gcd of two numbers.

## Notes on Last Exercise Sheet

+ I was surprised by how well they got solved on average!
+ **JUSTIFY EVERY STEP.** (I am sloppy in my solutions that I give you, but you need to justify **everything**!)
+ If you haven't already, take a look at 6.6 (a lot of old exam questions are similar)


## Exercise Sheet Recommendations

Pretty much all of them look useful to me. If you don't have time, then leave out the three-stars.
