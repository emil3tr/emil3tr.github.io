# Week 3 - Proof Patterns

This week we focus a lot on proof patterns since it is a **very** important topic. We also quickly review predicate logic.

## Resources

+ Slides: [pdf](/dm25_resources/week3/slides.pdf)
+ Proof Examples: [pdf](/dm25_resources/week3/proofexamples.pdf)
+ Kahoot: [link](https://create.kahoot.it/details/976378f9-ef78-4bab-b804-4d0534633cd9) made by Tobias Steinbrecher

## Notes on Last Exercise Sheet

+ Overall the submissions were very good (:
+ Be careful when you apply rules to larger formulas. You still need to keep the brackets. For example $\lnot (A \land B) \lor C$ becomes $(\lnot A \lot \lnot B) \lor C$ when using de Morgans rule!
+ By now you probably figured out that the grading scheme can be very strict, so don't be too discouraged if you lost a lot of points. 

## Proof Patterns

Read the script and look at [discmath.ch](https://discmath.ch/content/ch2/proof-patterns) for more examples. The proof patterns are very standard so you can also find good explanations on the internet.

## Exercise Sheet Recommendations

Do all the exercises! **3.6 2)** is a three-star, but actually not that difficult (and very similar to the example in the script if you need a hint), so definitely try it!
