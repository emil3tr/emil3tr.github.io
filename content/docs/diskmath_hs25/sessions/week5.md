# Week5 - Relations

This week we talk about relations and their properties. Then we look at equivalence relations and partial order relations.

## Notes on Last Exercise Sheet

+ Exercise 3) was hard. Don't worry if you couldn't solve it.
+ **Read the task description!!** If it says "every step needs to be justified", then every step needs to be justified.
+ You cannot just assume things (even if they are correct) without proving them. 
+ Don't manipulate formulas with 0, 1, $\top$, $\bot$. Write something like "since we know that ... is true we know that ...".
+ From now on you most likely won't need truth tables anymore. If you take more than one page or need to argue a lot and
in weird ways then there most likely is a more "clean" way to do it.
+ It is not enough if you understand your proof, the person who reads it needs to understand it.
+ Don't make things more complicated than they need to be. If you saw a method in class, try to do it exactly like that first.

## Exercise Sheet Recommendations

Do all of them! If you have to leave out one, then skip **5.5**.
