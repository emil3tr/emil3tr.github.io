## 2.1 Mathematical Statements

1. What is a *statement*?
2. What does the symbol $\Longrightarrow$ mean and when is $S \Longrightarrow T$ true?

## 2.2 The Concept of a Proof

1. When do we use $\dot{\Longrightarrow}$ instead of $\Longrightarrow$?
2. Describe (informally) what a proof is.
3. What is the difference between a *proof sketch* and a *formal proof*?

## 2.3 Propositional Logic

1. Explain the symbols $\lnot, \land, \lor, \rightarrow, \leftrightarrow$.
2. What is a *truth table*? Can you sketch the truth tables for the symbols above?
3. How did we define a *formula*? What symbols are allowed to appear in a formula? Can you think of
an arrow we saw that is not allowed to appear in a formula?
4. What does it mean for two formulas to be *equivalent*? What is the symbol for it?
5. **Lemma 2.1** is important. Can you name and write down all the eight rules? Where did you shee
similar rules before? 
6. What does the symbol $\models$ mean? Is $A \models B$ a statement or
a formula? Can you define $\equiv$ using $\models$? 
7. What makes a formula *(un)satisfiable* and what is a *tautology*? What is the connection
between $F$, $\lnot F$ and these terms?
8. Fill in the blanks with *formula* or *statement*:

+ "____ $\rightarrow$ ____" is a ____
+ "____ $\Rightarrow$ ____" is a ____
+ "____ $\models$ ____" is a ____


## 2.4 Predicate Logic

1. Give an example of a *predicate*.
2. Recall the definitions of $\forall x P(x)$ and $\exists x P(x)$. What else
needs to be specified apart from $P$?
3. Using both $\forall$ and $\exists$ at least once and two different predicates $P$ and $Q$,
construct a formula which is true for $U = \mathbb{N}$.
4. Read through **2.4.8** again and do the exercise if you have not already. Then take a sheet of
paper and try to write down all the rules you remember from that section.

## 2.6 Proof Patterns

1. Explain how an *indirect proof* works.
2. What is a *Modus Ponens*? Can you show with propositional logic why it works?
3. What steps does a proof by *case distinction* involve?
4. Show with propositional logic why a proof by *contradiction* works. How do you use this proof technique in prectice?
5. Explain intuitively and in your own words to yourself what a proof by *induction* is and why it works.
6. What is the *pigeonhole principle*?
